# Hello-world

Hi Everyone!

I am £aique, £aique M. Djeutchouang, a statistician, mathematical scientist who loves combining theories and programming skills to try to solve or address real-world challenges. I am a great lover of my home-country foods.

This is my first step on GitHub, the wonderfull code hosting platform for verrsion control and callaboration. It lets us and others work together on projects from everywhere around the wolrd.

# Make and commit changes

The first important thing I have learned is on GitHub, "Saved chnges" are called "Commits". Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the full history of your changes, so other contributors to the project can understand what you have done and why.

Ciao Ciao!
